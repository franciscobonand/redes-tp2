# How to run

From within the root folder (where the files `client.py`, `server.py`, `utils.py` and `dcc023c2` are) run the following command in the terminal:

```zsh
chmod +x dcc023c2
```

And it's done! The accepted commands are:  
`./dcc023c2 -s <port> <input> <output>` to run in server mode  
and  
`./dcc023c2 -c <IP> <port> <input> <output>` to run in client mode
